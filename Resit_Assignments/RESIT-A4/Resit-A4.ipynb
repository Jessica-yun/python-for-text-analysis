Please separate the year from the award name, so you can collect all books that received an award (regardless of the year they received it in). Please store the informatin about the year in the dictionary containing information about the book (using they key 'year received'). You can use string slicing to separate award name from year (usually, the last 6 characters of the award name refer to the year). In some cases, the award name does not have information about the year. If this is the case, 'year received' should have the value 'unknown'. Use a particular string method to test if the last six characters of the string (without the brackets) consist of digits. \n",
